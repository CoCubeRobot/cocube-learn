### Sensors

#### Sensors and relational operators

- In addition to the buttons, the ED1 board incorporates different sensors: light, temperature, tilt, etc.

- Given that these sensors give an analog value (that is, numerical) we will have to use **relational blocks** if we want to execute actions related to it.

- These blocks also return a true or false value, so they can be used with the conditional blocks we saw earlier.

##### Challenge 1: Show two different patterns on the screen by covering and uncovering the light sensor

#### Temperature sensor

- Another sensor integrated into the board is the temperature sensor.

- A very simple example that can be done is to add to the graph the value that the sensor gives us every X time (for example 1 second) to visualize it comfortably.

- We can even export the data in .csv format and open it with a spreadsheet program (MSOffice, LibreOffice, etc.)
