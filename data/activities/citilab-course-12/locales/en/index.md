### Controlling Lights with Hand Claps

#### DC motors

- With the **Microphone** library it is possible to detect the number of times one claps their hands.

- This detection allows us to activate any element of the home display, for example the lighting.

- The microphone is connected to the analog input **A1**.

#### Turtle Library

- To simulate different lighting levels we can use the screen.

- We can use the **fill display with _** block that we will find in the **Turtle** library instead of **draw rectangle ...** from the **TFT** library.
